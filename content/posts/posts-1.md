This site was built with Hugo Static Site Generator and deployed on Netlify through GitHub. 

Although I like Hugo a lot this is a temporary solution.
 
The main goal is to move this site into Devon's custom static site generator.
 
This will be probably one of Devon's first projects. 

In one of the following posts, we will see what would be the originality of the idea.

Devon intends to keep posts small but often.
